**GLOSSARY**

_The following glossary is part of an upcoming handbook about working at an agency and consists of terms that one would encounter while working in this sector._

_As is the case with all interdisciplinary vocations, there are many terms appearing below that one would expect to find in an, for example, "introduction to business" handbook. I tried to keep the selection as focused as possible by always asking the question "is it possible that someone new to this field might not know what X is exactly?"._

_All glossaries and dictionaries are by their own nature, obsolete the moment they are published. As such, this glossary will be regularly updated and re-released with new entries and edits._

In cases of non--paid advertising, it calculates how much a campaign would have cost, had it been paid for.

Usually refers to the text found at the end of each Press Release or other official communiqués which contains information on the company/organization that released the document.

## CC

Acronym for Carbon Copy. An email term for additional receivers of a particular correspondence. Most email services have an additional space below "To" where the user can add additional receivers of the correspondence. The idea is that the message is intended for the person in the "To" section but the others who are CC'd only need to know about its content and the fact that the message exists. Although there is no official email etiquette as it varies from company to company, people who are CC'd are not expected to reply to the message unless to intervene. If one is expecting a reply from someone, they should be included in the "To" section.

## CMYK

Acronym for the colour collection Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key which is acts as a code for a particular shade of colour. "Key" is sometimes used to refer to the colour black, but strictly speaking, it refers to a colour plate in which all colours are used. For example, the CMYK code for "Persian Blue" is 85%, 70%, 0%, and 27%, where each percentage corresponds to the appropriate colour in the CMYK sequence. CMYK differs from RGB in that it is used in printing, as these are the colors used to generate all hues. Contrasted with RBG which is the colour code used in computer monitors. Since the colours seen on a monitor are the result of colors added to a black screen and printing is a process of removing colors from a white surface (since black is essentially "no color" and white is "all colors"), we had to develop the two different systems to codify color hues.

## COB
