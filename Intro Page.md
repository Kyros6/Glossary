**GLOSSARY**

_The following glossary is part of an upcoming handbook about working at an agency and consists of terms that one would encounter while working in this sector._

_As is the case with all interdisciplinary vocations, there are many terms appearing below that one would expect to find in an, for example, "introduction to business" handbook. I tried to keep the selection as focused as possible by always asking the question "is it possible that someone new to this field might not know what X is exactly?"._

_All glossaries and dictionaries are by their own nature, obsolete the moment they are published. As such, this glossary will be regularly updated and re-released with new entries and edits._
